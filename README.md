## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I had to think through the best way to display the text when the button was clicked. I felt that conditional redering was the best approach. Using state, I had a simple flad that would cause the FAQ answer to be rendered or not. I also thought about toggling a class that would hide the text, but I wanted to work more with React state even if it was relatively simple.

### Continued development

I would like to experiment with using a CSS framework, but I need to practice the fundementals first.
